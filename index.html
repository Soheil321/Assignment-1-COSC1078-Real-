				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>I am an Australian born male with an Iranian background. I speak farsi (the Iranian language) almost fluently. I previously studied a Bachelors of Biomedicine at Latrobe University but dropped out as I decided it was not for me in terms of interest and job prospects. I like to go to the gym to lift weights as I want to be fit and play video games like Valorant and League of Legends. I also take Muay Thai classes for fitness and self-defense. A fun fact about me is that I have one cat. Her name is Jessie, and she is a 7yr old tabby cat and super cute. </p>

				<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
			</header>
			
			<p>I've always been fascinated with computers and coding from a younger age. The way that information is rooted in technology is so interesting to me and the functionality of it all. Movies and games made hacking and stuff seem really cool too. My interest in IT has always been there but my decision to move into it started last year while I was still studying biomedicine. I lost interest for the world of biosciences as I realized that the world is moving in the path of technology and the way our information is moved and stored and the job prospects that could come from that and so I thought it was best to move to IT. 
			I have pretty much no experience in IT or coding of any kind besides an introductory python course I took in year 10 and remember nothing from. I always heard great things about RMIT and its IT department. How it was one of the best places you could go to learn IT. The location in the city also made it very convenient for me to get to and to get everything I need. 
			I hope to learn about the way information is moved, organized, stored and displayed in the modern technological world. I want to learn how to code and design all kinds of things from websites networks and apps.

			<img src="img/job.png">
			<p>This job is that of a cybersecurity consultant for a cybersecurity company called Legato Technologies. The reason this job is appealing to me is because it would allow me to display my cybersecurity expertise and to help shakeup the cybersecurity world. 
			The Job would require and in-depth knowledge of cybersecurity systems and networks. It needs me to show risk management abilities as well as being able to assure clients of cybersecurity. It would need me to show experience with cyber security frameworks and assessment of the security of their networks.  I would need to demonstrate a best possible experience with cloud platforms, effectively being able to communicate information in both technical and non-technical ways so that all audiences may understand. 
			I am currently far from reaching this point with my level of skill and expertise. I currently am only at a beginner level with both html and python and have pretty much no knowledge of the industry or consulting work. 
			I plan to study IT in this course with a major in cybersecurity. I hope to get an internship with a cybersecurity consulting company in my second year to experience the work environment and the industry standards. I hope to develop a detailed understanding of cybersecurity and defense frameworks throughout this course. Upon graduation I hope to get a government job in cybersecurity for 3 years to gain the required experience and apply for my desired job.

			<h2>Personal Profile </h2>

			<h3>Myers-Brigg Test </h3>
			<h4>Result: Virtuoso, Personality ISTP-A / ISTP-T</h4>
			<p>The results of this test showed me that I'm a curious person who likes to take things apart myself to see how they work. It showed me that I like to play around with things and learn through testing as well as trial and error. It made me realise that I like to have the freedom to play around with my work without interruption from others and that I like to work alone which all resonated with me. 
			These results reflect my personality in that I don't like working in groups and prefer to work on my own, however I will have to force myself to do so as it is a requirement in both university and the professional working world. 
			The results display that I will have to find a way to be delegated a task that would allow me to freely play around with my work when having to work in a team. This would be so that I could work to my fullest potential in a comfortable environment. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Education Planner.org Learning Style Test</h3>
			<h4>Result:  40% Auditory, 25% Visual, Tactile 35% </h4>
			<p>The results of this test show me that I am best learning when I hear the content and material as apposed to reading it. I am shown to be a majority auditory learner, and this resonated with me as I always found lectures videos and helped me learn better than slides because the lecturer would be able to describe the content in a more clear and understandable way. 
			Having work clearly delegated to me and described would make it easier for me to understand and work within a group setting so that the work could be done in a timely fashion with good quality. 
			When forming a team, I would like to establish clear communication with my team so that all work would be clear and delegated accordingly so that we could all work together effectively in cohesion. 
			</p>
			
			<h3>Truity: The Big Five Personality Test </h3>
			<h4>Result: 46% Openness, 33% Conscientious, 29% Extraversion, 65% Agreeableness, 75% Neuroticism </h4>
			<p>The result show me that although I'm prone to thinking negatively and have neurotic tendencies, I am also more prone to putting others before myself and working with others rather than compete with them. 
			In a team setting this would show me as being able to not only get my work done but when needed, I can put my needs aside for the good of my team to get our work done and assist them however needed. 
			When forming my team I would need to try and put my neurotic behavior aside so as to allow me to work effectively with my team and get our work done in a timely and efficient manner.

			<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			</header>
			<h3>Multi Host IP Looper</h3>
			<p> 
			The idea behind this project is to create a program which will make your IP address virtually untraceable. Normal VPNs will just host your IP in a different location which although its safe, is still possible to trace through the company hosting. The MHIPL or Mipl, creates an untraceable IP by quite literally bouncing your IP address off of multiple site hosts at a constant rate so that it can never truly be pinned down anywhere. The Mipl is a program that is created to ensure internet safety and privacy at the highest level, ensuring your information is always protected. 
			Our world is one where technology is ever-expanding with more and more of our information both professional and personal is up in the cloud supposedly secure. The reality is that with all your valuable information up in the cloud, the right people with the right skillset are going to be able to access that information and know everything about you and this is something that happens all the time. VPNs are the current commercial tool for data encryption and protection however even VPNs can be vulnerable and are not meant to run continuously and thus the Mipl will be the next step in cyber security. 
			The MHIPL or the Mipl is the future of commercial cyber security. Utilizing multiple databases and DNS server hosts around the world, this program's function isn't to just mask your IP Address in one single location but to instead as the name spells out, Loop your already encrypted IP address through multiple server hosts at a constant rate so that there is not  possibility for your IP to be tracked or pinned down in one place like a sitting duck. You wouldn't have to manually switch to another host for protection as you are automatically constantly being looped and bounced off of multiple hosts around the world. Using already existing public key encryption that all VPNs use, your IP address will be safe. The difference is that your IP will eb constantly moving around between server hosts so the potential hackers can't even trace it let alone try and gain access to it. It's a simple matter of just booting up your computer and switching on Mipl and just like that your IP address is moving around the world at a constantly fast rate. There is also no pattern to trace for hackers who may want to try predicting where your IP may end up and accessing it there as the locations your IP is moving through are decided at random via a random location generator. All of this at its base level will be coded through python using proprietary encryption software. The combination of multi-layered encryption and a constantly moving masked IP address makes you virtually untraceable and thus fully protected on the net. This program will both change the scape of network protection and cybersecurity and allow the general consumer to have the peace of mind knowing that they'll be safe browsing the net. The only weakness would the constant language changes that would occur when switching between servers so fast but there could be workarounds for this.
			To make this project work we would need multiple running server banks on home ground as well as access to multiple server hosts worldwide. That and using anaconda navigator, google collab, Jupiter notebook or any other programs to code python on as well as access to public key encryption software. Also the use of SQL software to create a database to organize the networks and manage the servers via a database Using these programs and servers is all we would need to get this project off the ground.
			Skills required would be an in-depth knowledge of database management and SQL software, in-depth knowledge of and experience with coding in python, in-depth knowledge of encryption software and using python to develop encryptions. Another important skill would be managing servers and assembly of servers to provide technical support should something go wrong with any of them.
			Overall this project will change the landscape of digital privacy and protection in a  bid to keep our information safe and private from potential hackers. This will surpass VPNs as the go to consumer level digital privacy and protection as it would ensure total protection on the internet and the cloud.
